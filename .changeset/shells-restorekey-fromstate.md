`restoreKey` restores a remounted inner shell in place. The value stored under `data[restoreKey]` is still the inner `PathSnapshot` (so outer steps keep reading `data.<key>.data.<field>`), but it now also carries a `serializedState` field — the inner engine's `exportState()`. On remount the inner engine is rebuilt from it with `PathEngine.fromState()` instead of starting the path and jumping to the step, which re-ran `onEnter` on the first step and `onLeave` / `onEnter` on the way to the target on every remount and lost attempted / visited state (a blocked attempt's errors vanished when the user came back). A stored value without `serializedState`, written by an older version, still restores the old way. Every shell has a remount test for this. Angular's `PathFacade` gains an `engine` getter.
